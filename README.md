## Overview

This Java Spring Boot project is designed to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality via REST API endpoints. It utilizes the Spring Boot framework and integrates with an H2 in-memory database, making it easy to develop and test without the need for external database setups.

## Features

- CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete entities via RESTful endpoints.
- H2 in-memory database: Allows for quick development and testing without the need for external database setups.
- Spring Boot: Provides a robust and efficient framework for building Java-based applications.
- RESTful API: Follows RESTful principles for easy integration and consumption by other applications.



## Usage

Once the application is running, you can perform CRUD operations using the following REST API endpoints:

- `GET /api/entities`: Retrieve all entities.
- `GET /api/entities/{id}`: Retrieve an entity by ID.
- `POST /api/entities`: Create a new entity.
- `PUT /api/entities/{id}`: Update an existing entity.
- `DELETE /api/entities/{id}`: Delete an entity by ID.

Replace `{id}` with the ID of the entity you want to perform operations on.
